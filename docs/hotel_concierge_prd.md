- **Greeting**: "Welcome to our restaurant service, how may I help you today?"
- **Interface**: Video call-style interaction with AI avatar

### 2. AI Avatar Integration
- **Technology**: Tavus AI Avatar
- **Purpose**: Visual representation during voice interactions
- **Experience**: Video conference-style room service interface

### 3. Order Management Workflow

#### Phase 1: Menu Interaction
- Present available menu items (3-5 hardcoded items)
- Validate order against available inventory
- Reject orders for unavailable items
- Use evaluation loops for accurate order processing

#### Phase 2: Customer Information Collection
- **Required Details**:
  - Room number
  - Booking name
- Structured data collection through conversation

#### Phase 3: Order Confirmation
- Present complete order summary to customer
- Request final approval/rejection
- **Approval**: Proceed to database storage
- **Rejection**: End call gracefully

#### Phase 4: Order Completion
- Store order in local database
- Generate unique reference ID
- Provide confirmation with ticket number

## Technical Architecture

### Backend (FastAPI)
```
/order (POST)
- Accept complete order details
- Store in Prisma database
- Return confirmation with reference ID

/menu (GET)
- Return hardcoded menu items (3-5 items)
- JSON format response

/admin (GET)
- Authentication required (username: "admin", password: "admin")
- Display orders dashboard
- Show complete order details with timestamps
- Beautified visualization
```

### Database (Prisma ORM)
- **Local SQLite database**
- **Order Schema**:
  - Order ID (unique)
  - Room number
  - Booking name
  - Menu items ordered
  - Timestamp
  - Status
  - Reference ID

### Frontend (React/Next.js)
- **Technology**: React with Daily.co WebRTC SDK
- **Requirements**: Real-time video chat interface with transcription
- **Components**:
  - Tavus AI avatar video interface (via Daily.co WebRTC)
  - Real-time chat transcription display
  - Order status display
  - Basic admin dashboard for order management
- **Features**:
  - Live transcription in chat layout
  - WebRTC video streaming
  - Responsive design for hotel room tablets/devices

### Voice AI Pipeline
- **Framework**: Pipecat flows with Tavus integration
- **Installation**: `pip install "pipecat-ai[tavus]"`
- **Language**: Python
- **WebRTC**: Daily.co for real-time communication
- **Integration**: Built-in `TavusVideoService` for avatar synchronization
- **Capabilities**:
  - Speech-to-text conversion
  - Natural language understanding via LLM
  - Text-to-speech output
  - Real-time video avatar lip-sync
  - Conversation state management
  - Live transcription display

## Success Metrics (MVP)

1. **Order Accuracy**: Correct order capture and validation
2. **Reference System**: Successful ticket generation with unique IDs
3. **Menu Validation**: Proper rejection of unavailable items
4. **Data Persistence**: Reliable database storage
5. **Admin Access**: Functional dashboard for order management
6. **Conversation Flow**: Complete end-to-end ordering process

## User Stories
