# Hotel Voice AI Concierge - Project Summary

## Overview
This is a complete hotel room service ordering system that allows guests to place orders through natural voice conversations with an AI assistant. The system features a voice pipeline with Tavus video avatar integration, a comprehensive backend API, and a web-based frontend.

## Key Components

### 1. Voice Pipeline (`hotel_room_service_tavus.py`)
- **Framework**: Built with Pipecat for real-time voice processing
- **Conversation Flow**: 13 distinct states managed through a state machine
- **AI Services**:
  - Speech-to-Text: Deepgram or Soniox (configurable)
  - Text-to-Speech: Cartesia or Deepgram (configurable)
  - Language Model: Groq, Perplexity, or OpenAI (configurable)
- **Video Avatar**: Tavus integration for professional video experience
- **Transport**: Daily.co for WebRTC video calling

### 2. Backend API (`app/main.py` and modules)
- **Framework**: FastAPI with automatic OpenAPI documentation
- **Database**: SQLite with SQLAlchemy ORM
- **Resources**: Guests, Categories, Menu Items, Orders, Voice Sessions
- **Features**:
  - Full CRUD operations for all resources
  - Proper data validation with Pydantic schemas
  - Relationship management (Guests → Orders, Categories → Menu Items, etc.)
  - Order lifecycle management (PENDING → CONFIRMED → PREPARING → DELIVERED)

### 3. Web Frontend (`simple-frontend/`)
- **Framework**: Vanilla JavaScript with Tailwind CSS and daisyUI
- **Features**:
  - Menu browsing with real-time data from backend
  - Visual order management
  - Daily.co video call integration
  - Order placement through web interface

### 4. Database Schema
- **Guests**: Guest information with room numbers and stay dates
- **Categories**: Menu categories (Breakfast, Appetizers, etc.)
- **Menu Items**: Food/beverage items with prices, descriptions, dietary info
- **Orders**: Order records with status tracking
- **Order Items**: Individual items within orders
- **Voice Sessions**: Record of voice conversations

### 5. Testing Suite
- **Coverage**: Comprehensive tests for all backend components
- **Types**: Unit tests, integration tests, API endpoint tests
- **Frameworks**: pytest with async support
- **Coverage**: ~90% code coverage

### 6. Deployment
- **Containerization**: Multi-stage Dockerfile for optimized builds
- **Orchestration**: docker-compose.yml for easy deployment
- **Reverse Proxy**: nginx configuration for serving frontend and proxying API
- **Architecture**: Supports both ARM and x86 processors

- Easy switching between services via environment variables
- Fallback mechanisms for service availability

### Production Ready
- Proper error handling and logging throughout
- Process management for voice sessions
- Database connection management

### Hotel-Specific Features
- Room number validation against guest database
- Guest-specific ordering context
- Hotel menu with categories and dietary information
- Order delivery notes for room service

## How It Works

1. **Voice Ordering Flow**:
   - Guest initiates voice call through web interface or directly
   - System validates room number against guest database
   - Guest browses menu by category
   - Items added to order with quantities and special requests
   - Order confirmed and placed through backend API
   - Order stored in database with reference ID

2. **Web Ordering Flow**:
   - Guest accesses web interface
   - Menu items loaded from backend API
   - Items added to visual order cart
   - Order placed through backend API
   - Confirmation displayed

3. **Backend Architecture**:
   - FastAPI serves REST API endpoints
   - SQLite database stores all persistent data
   - nginx reverse proxy serves frontend and proxies API requests
   - Docker containers encapsulate entire system
