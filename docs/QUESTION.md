# Hotel Concierge AI System - Technical Improvement Plan

## Current Situation Analysis

I've developed a working prototype of a voice-enabled hotel concierge system, but it's fundamentally misaligned with my employer's expectations. They're looking for a more sophisticated AI system that incorporates modern techniques like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), vector databases, and comprehensive evaluation frameworks.

### Current Implementation Issues
- Using SQL database queries instead of RAG for menu item retrieval
- Missing key components like vector databases, transcript storage, and evaluation tools
- Lacks advanced features like cosine similarity, hybrid search, and chain-of-thought reasoning
- No proper logging or evaluation framework for LLM performance
- Missing emotional intelligence and advanced TTS capabilities

### Employer's Requirements
The system should incorporate these technologies:
- RAG based system
- Storing transcripts
- Vector DB
- include a n8n type workflow so that we can trigger a remote addition of csv row in google sheets which will resemble to the order confirmation ticket once the order is placed. (thus showing the idea of a ticket providing back like reference id)
- Langflow for better visualizaiton for the whole workflow.
- Connect and eval tool or build custom eval tool for STT (transcriber model), LLM, and TTS (text to speech)
- Intent classification * metadata
- better Logging for capturing the agents response
- Log -> suitability of field -> populating right fields (here field are the key parameters requried before placing the order)
- Cosine similarities, for a better retrieval of the menu items.
- Chain of thought reasoning method 
- Retrieval model
- Hybrid search
- Iterations of model (different model versions of prototype and the explanation of why the later model is better than the prev one.)
- Better TTS model
- Emotional intelligence, how long to wait, how to respond, like when to pause, how to appreciate the user, laughter, (kinda as similar to the real human being) how to make it more intelligent


### Specific Use Case
They want to use PDF menu items parsed by vector embeddings so that the LLM can query them and ask multi-step iterations, then confirm which fields to fill to place the order. With logs of these interactions, it will be easier to evaluate and improve the voice AI conversation.

## Consolidated Questions

1. How can I transition from a SQL-based menu retrieval system to a RAG-based approach using vector databases for the hotel concierge system?

2. What are the essential components and architecture for implementing a RAG system with vector databases in a hotel concierge application?

3. How should I implement transcript storage and logging mechanisms to support later evaluation of the voice AI system?

4. What tools and frameworks should I use for building evaluation systems for LLM performance in this specific context?

5. How can I implement intent classification with metadata for better understanding of guest requests?

6. What approaches should I take for cosine similarity calculations and fact-checking mechanisms?

7. How can I integrate chain-of-thought reasoning methods into the conversation flow?

8. What are the best practices for implementing hybrid search combining both keyword and semantic search?

9. How should I structure the system to support iterations and different model versions for continuous improvement?

10. What are the options for better TTS models that can add emotional intelligence, appropriate pauses, and natural conversation patterns?

11. How can I implement emotional intelligence in the AI responses - determining appropriate wait times, response styles, and making conversations more intelligent?

12. Which frameworks like LangGraph should I learn and implement for this type of workflow?

13. What white papers or research should I study to better understand knowledge representation in hospitality AI systems?

14. How can I structure the development process with proper planning and iterations to demonstrate improvements over previous versions?

15. What are the best practices for connecting with tools like n8n and Langflow in this context?

16. How should I approach populating the right fields from conversation logs for order processing?
