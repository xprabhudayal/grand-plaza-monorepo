# Hotel Voice AI Concierge - Technical Presentation

## Project Overview

### **🎯 Core Concept**
- Voice-first restaurant ordering system for hotel room service
- Guests can place orders through natural voice conversations
- Full backend REST API with database storage
- Integrated web frontend for visual ordering

### **🏨 Solution Architecture**
- FastAPI backend with SQLite database
- Pipecat-based voice pipeline with state management
- Multi-service integration (STT, TTS, LLM)
- Web frontend with Daily.co video calling
- Tavus video avatar integration

---

## Key Technical Features

### **🎙️ Voice Pipeline Implementation**
- Pipecat framework for real-time voice processing
- Flow-based conversation management with 13 distinct states
- Multiple STT providers (Deepgram/Soniox) with fallback support
- Multiple LLM providers (Groq/Perplexity/OpenAI) with fallback support
- Cartesia TTS for natural voice synthesis
- Tavus video avatar for enhanced visual experience

### **🍽️ Menu & Order Management**
- Comprehensive menu system with 7 categories and 30+ items
- Full order lifecycle management (creation, modification, confirmation)
- Database schema with proper relationships (Guests, Orders, Menu Items)
- Real-time order storage and retrieval via REST API

### **🛡️ Type Safety & Validation**
- Pydantic schemas for request/response validation
- Strict type checking for all API endpoints
- Automatic API documentation with OpenAPI/Swagger
- Enum-based status management for orders and sessions

### **🧪 Comprehensive Testing**
- Full test suite covering all backend components
- Unit tests for models, schemas, and services
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Database transaction and cascade operation tests

- Function calling for each conversation step with proper error handling
- Context preservation throughout the conversation
- Sophisticated order management with add/remove items capability

### **🧩 Multi-Provider Integration**
- No vendor lock-in for voice AI infrastructure
- Configurable providers for STT, LLM, and TTS services
- Fallback mechanisms for service availability
- Easy switching between providers via environment variables

### **📹 Tavus Video Avatar**

## System Architecture

### **🏗️ Backend Structure**
- FastAPI REST API for data management with 5 main resource types (Guests, Categories, Menu Items, Orders, Voice Sessions)
- SQLAlchemy ORM with SQLite database
- Modular router design for API endpoints
- Environment-based configuration management

### **📱 Frontend Implementation**
- Simple web interface for order placement with visual menu
- Daily.co video calling integration for voice sessions
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS and daisyUI components
- Real-time menu loading from backend API

### **🔗 Integration Points**
- Daily.co for WebRTC video transport
- Multiple AI service providers (Deepgram, Cartesia, Groq, etc.)
- Tavus for video avatar streaming
- Standard REST API for external system integration

## Deployment & Containerization

### **🐳 Docker Support**
- Multi-stage Dockerfile for optimized production deployment
- Docker Compose for multi-service orchestration
- Nginx reverse proxy for serving frontend and proxying API requests
- ARM and x86 architecture support

### **⚡ Performance Considerations**
- Async processing for non-blocking operations
- Database connection management with proper session handling
- Caching strategies for menu data
- Efficient voice pipeline processing

### **🔐 Security & Reliability**
- Environment-based secret management
- Input validation and sanitization
- CORS support for web frontend
- Error handling and logging throughout the system
- Process management for voice sessions with proper cleanup
